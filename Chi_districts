#Step 1. Problem to solve - Determine safest districts to live in for 2020
#Step 2. How to solve it with data - Use prior years district data to determine trend of crime and predict 2020 crime amount 
#Step 3. Needed Data - district, year, fbi_code, primary
#Step 4. Data Source - `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
#Step 5. Is the data representative of the problem - Yes, it speaks to past crime trends in districts
#Step 6. Data Wrangle - Organize data by year and districts then seem previous rise and fall per district and use that to determine 2020s numbers with a predictive ML model.
#Step 7. How to visualize the data - Graph of crime trends Bar chart of final numbers 
#Step 8. Does the model and approach answer the question - Model indeed gives me predictions of 2020 crime data for districts
#Step 9. Can model be put into practice - YES
#Step 10. Feedback -
